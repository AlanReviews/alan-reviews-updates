I am planning to review Stardew Valley for an anticipated review request. So far, I did a lot of research in learning about Stardew Valley and C#. The title of the video will be Stardew Valley and C# Review and Discussion. I managed to gather some co-op gameplay footage. Progress is going slow. I am still writing the script and recording gameplay. The game has a lot of content. Eventually, I will get the video done. I don't know when the video will be released.

I am enjoying Stardew Valley. I am learning a lot about the game. I enjoyed interacting with members of the Stardew Valley Discord server. They are helpful and great. Currently, the script is 10 pages long. I haven't finished the script yet. I am still playing the game and writing the script. 

I performed some research on farming and fishing to gather information. I am reading farming books to get an idea on how farming works and its history. With this knowledge, I can understand Stardew Valley's gameplay and world better. I created the introduction of the video and the thumbnail.

In addition, I am planning to make a farm tour and review video and a 1.6 update review video. They will happen after my Stardew Valley review. I haven't started on these videos yet.

Thanks for reading this update.
