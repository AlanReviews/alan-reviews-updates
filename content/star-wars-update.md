In this update, I will be discussing some changes made to the reviews and requests list, LEGO Star Wars Force Awakens, LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga, and Star Wars Jedi Survivor.

I cancelled the Star Wars Battlefront (2015) review. [According to SteamCharts, the player counts are low.](https://steamcharts.com/app/1237980) I am afraid that I cannot find multiplayer games to do a full review. There are other videos that do a Battlefront 2015 review. Eventually, I will review the older Battlefront games. 

I am planning to review LEGO Star Wars The Force Awakens. I already seen the film and played it a little bit. After my first playthrough, I decided to make a review on it. 
In the video, I will be discussing the history and the LEGO game of Star Wars The Force Awakens. The video **will not** be a film review. I don't know when the video review will be released. I am trying to record it on my Xbox One. If I can't get the Xbox One version working, I will do it on PC.

So here is my plan
1. Rewatch The Force Awakens film
2. Research Star Wars The Force Awakens to learn about the lore
3. Record LEGO Star Wars The Force Awakens gameplay
4. Edit the video
5. Release the video

I will do a review on LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga. I expect the video will take a long time to make. I do not have a copy of LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga. I am planning to watch the films and do my review. I do not have an anticipated date to release the video.

Here is my plan:
1. Watch The Last Jedi and The Rise of Skywalker
2. Research Star Wars to learn about the lore
3. Record LEGO Star Wars The Skywalker Saga gameplay
4. Edit the video
5. Release the video

For Star Wars Jedi Survivor, I will be taking a look at it after I review Jedi Fallen Order. I do not have an anticipated date to release the video.
