For upcoming and future video reviews, I can get some footage recorded on Xbox One with Xbox One DVR. One problem with recording Xbox One footage with the DVR is that the length is 2 minutes.

I can use an external hard drive to store footage for up to 10 minutes. I will see what I can do to gather Xbox One footage. Stay tuned for more videos!
