I create short reviews on my YouTube channel, such as my [Android Puzzlebot review](https://youtube.com/shorts/DlVcomTXTB4?si=HlSpkp1cOmLfWVf6). I use the short-form video format to review LEGO sets and games that don’t require extensive discussion, allowing me to record in a vertical format. My YouTube shorts are 1 to 3 minutes long. Examples are small LEGO sets and short video games. This approach enables me to produce and share content more efficiently.

Of course, not every video will follow this format. I’m currently working on some new videos, so stay tuned! I hope you enjoy my short reviews. Let me know what you think about them!
