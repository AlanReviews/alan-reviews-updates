Between January to April, I will be busy. There will be infrequent uploads. Eventually, I will fulfill the review requests and some planned reviews.

<!-- more -->

Here is a list of upcoming review videos I will release:
- LEGO Classic Brick Separator
- LEGO Harry Potters Years 1 - 4 (PC)
- [Review Requests] Stardew Valley (PC)
- LEGO Builder's Journey (PC)
- And various other videos

I don't know when these videos will be released. I am taking my time to explore and learn about the games.

Stay tuned for more videos and updates. [Subscribe](https://www.youtube.com/@TheAlanReviews?sub_confirmation=1) to be notified when these videos will be released!
