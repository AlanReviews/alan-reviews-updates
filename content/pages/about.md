Hello, I am Alan. I run my YouTube channel The Alan Reviews. I review LEGOs, video games, and technologies. In addition, I post vlogs, slideshows, and gameplay clips. All my videos are safe for work and kid-friendly.

Since I was a child, I have an interest in LEGOS, video games, and technologies. After watching review videos on YouTube, I was inspired to create my own channel dedicated to reviews. I developed this website.

I like playing all kinds of games. I am interested in trying out new things.

In addition, I am interested in programming. I can program in C/C++, Java, JavaScript, Python, R, and Rust. I created this website with the Zola template engine.

Here is my YouTube trailer:
