Here are my frequently asked questions. These questions address everything I do on my channel. I will add more questions when I get more FAQs. These questions will never be answered in a questions and answer video.
# What do I review?
I review LEGOs, technologies, and video games on my YouTube channel. In addition, I wrote a few reviews on places I visited on Google Maps.

If the game achieves a review score of 6 or higher, I will review the mods. Mods enhance and expand games. Mods should not fix games or attempt to manipulate my score system. Mods should not make games better.

I will use mods if I need to change the game settings such as changing the field of view or getting better textures.

I will review expansion packs and DLC content if the game stands on its own and there is something to review (achieves a score of 6 or higher). The only exception is standalone expansion packs.

# What is the 10 rating scale about?
The rating system measures my enjoyment and quality of a product. Here is my rating system in a table format

| Rating | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| 10 | Perfect, Outstanding. A must have. Has few or no negative qualities |
| 9 | Amazing |
| 8 | Great |
| 7 | Fine, good |
| 6 | Ok, average |
| 5 | Mediocre |
| 4 | Underwhelming |
| 3 | Bad |
| 2 | Terrible |
| 1 | Boring |
| 0 | Loath, despise. I hope no video review gets this score. Has no redeeeming qualities. |


# What is your criteria if something will get reviewed?
First, I have to perform research to see if there is something I can talk about in the product. If there is nothing to talk about, I will not make a review.
For LEGOs, tech, and video games, I test the product to see if there are things I can talk about it. Once I found some talking points during the test, I will accept the product for review. If I cannot find any talking points, I  will not make a video review. For video games, I test them on my computer to ensure I can run the game at 1080p and 30 to 60 frames per second or better.

There are some LEGO sets, video games, and technologies that I refuse to review. I explained why under the denial reason section in my [Review and Requests List.](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSWIyo2ktAkKEQqLVwAdy3DvQLO9YzbPntU65-13nfNvZa-d5ohtd5lHEiijEz_erW8qeKwlS7wuoYW/pubhtml)

For a LEGO set, video game, or technology to get a maybe, I have a hesitant feeling to make a video review on it.

# What are my subscriber milestones?
Here is what I plan when I get a certain amount of subscribers on a YouTube channel

| Subscribers | Milestone |
| --- | --- |
| 1000 | I will do a Q&A video |
| 1500 | I will do a setup tour video |

I am unsure what other milestones I will do when I get more subscribers. If you have any ideas, feel free to let me know.
